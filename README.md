# Credit Card Approval Model

## Project Description
This project develops a predictive model for credit card approval using Python and machine learning techniques. The aim is to predict whether a credit card application should be approved based on the applicant's financial data. This model leverages logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and neural networks to analyze and predict outcomes.
